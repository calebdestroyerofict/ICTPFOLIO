  <p class="gg6" style="height:469px;">I have learned a lot this quarter. Mostly about CSS. It really is much easier to use this as it gives us students a better time of understanding the proper aspects of HTML. I now truly understand how useful CSS is after having experienced using it this quarter. I think that using this will give me an easier time to code as to me, using CSS is kind of like a shortcut now. I learnt from the 1st Quarter and I have applied that same knowledge onto the work I have today. I truly wish that all will go well with this portfolio as I really worked hard on it. Till we meet again. May God be with us all. Thank you!<br>
